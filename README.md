## 🔐 Zero Trust AWS Cloud Security Project  

Designed and implemented a **production-style Zero Trust architecture in AWS**, emphasizing identity-first access, private infrastructure, and full audit visibility.

### 🔑 Key Security Implementations
- 🚫 **No public EC2 access** — all administration via **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**
- 🔐 **IAM role-based access control** using least privilege policies
- 🌐 **Private VPC design** with isolated subnets and VPC endpoints
- 📜 **Centralized logging and monitoring** with AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch
- 🪣 **Secure S3 logging buckets** with restrictive bucket policies
- 🧩 **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)** for repeatable and auditable deployments

### 🧠 Security Concepts Demonstrated
- Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)
- Identity-first cloud access
- Secure cloud networking
- Logging, monitoring, and audit readiness
- Cost-aware resource teardown and governance

📌 *Built as a portfolio-grade cloud security lab aligned with real-world enterprise security practices.*
